###sapling responsive  
# a responsive theme for localwiki
this theme retains most of the default styles of localwiki's core sapling theme while allowing better readability on a wide array of viewport sizes.  

## issues / to-do:  
- tables and images haven't been dealt with at all yet. that shit could get ugly still on small screens.  
- changes have been kinda mixed in with default code. that's a little messy. i'll try to separate out the new responsive stuff from the old css styles a little more.  
- the edit page looks like a pile of nasty on small screens. it just doesn't work. making editing work on a small screen seems like it'll take some serious refactoring of the ckeditor css.
